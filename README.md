## NxM Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a multilingual console program that allows to play Tic Tac Toe with computer with parameterized board size (NxM).
Computer player simply choose fields randomly. I also made AI version (not included here - .exe available only on recruiter request).
AI doesn't use neither MinMax nor neural networks - it is based on my own algorithm idea. It makes decision fast and smart even on big boards (which is impossible e.g. with MinMax it takes a lot of time due to its computational complexity).
